-couldn't access data on the windows side bc path didn't exist
-copied over into a data folder in the ubuntu side

-make sure I know what the file type is so I'm getting the right library

-Actually easier to create a country list, loop through, look for instances of the country, and then write those
    -countries is a global variable
    -if the country exists, we append the new yarn column
    -if the country doesn't exist, it creates a country as it goes

-start as JSON object, then build a CSV at the end

{
    "country":"USA",
    "yarns": [
        {"name":"yarn1",
        "tradeValue": "333",
        "type": "yarn"}
    ]
}

-write a rule for setting the types
